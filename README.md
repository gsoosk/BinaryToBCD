 The circuit to design in this assignment is one that takes a 16-bit binary number as its parallel input that is between 0 and 9999, and as output, it generates the BCD equivalent of its input. In addition to the BCD cascading blocks used in the previous experiment, the circuit has a 16-bit shift registrar and a counter that counts up to 16. We also have a controller that handles start-done handshaking and counts the number of shifts.
